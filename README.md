# LFS - Linux From Scratch

Why LFS matters (especially if you care about OS internals)
- Understand how a Linux system boots (firmware → bootloader → kernel → init).
- Learn toolchain bootstrapping (temporary vs final GCC/glibc).
- See dependency ordering and why it matters.
- Gain confidence in debugging low-level build failures.
- Build intuition for ABI, libc, linker, and runtime paths.

If you’re interested in OS architecture, kernel–userland boundaries, or embedded systems, LFS is gold.
